# Data-Analysis-in-Baseball
In this project, we'll be wrangling and Visualizing Statcast data comparing two baseball players(Aaron Judgeand Giancarlo Stanton). Within, this exploration, we'll compare the home runs and see how well they stack up against each other. Some libraries we'll use are Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data. 
For knowledge, Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking system that uses high-resolution cameras and radar equipment to measure the precise location and movement of baseballs and baseball players.
